# TFLite Model Maker

## Overview

The TFLite Model Maker library simplifies the process of adapting and converting
a TensorFlow neural-network model to particular input data when deploying this
model for on-device ML applications.

## Requirements

* Refer to
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/tensorflow_examples/lite/model_maker/requirements.txt)
for dependent libraries that're needed to use the library and run the demo code.

## Installation

Two alternative methods to install Model Maker library with its dependencies.

*   Install directly.

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git#egg=tensorflow-examples[model_maker]
```

*   Clone the repo from the HEAD, and then install with pip.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples
cd examples
pip install .[model_maker]
```

## End-to-End Example

For instance, it could have an end-to-end image
classification example that utilizes this library with just 4 lines of
code, each of which representing one step of the overall process:

1.   Load input data specific to an on-device ML app.

```python
data = ImageClassifierDataLoader.from_folder('flower_photos/')
```

2. Customize the TensorFlow model.

```python
model = image_classifier.create(data)
```

3. Evaluate the model.

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate()
```

4.  Export to Tensorflow Lite model.

```python
model.export('flower_classifier.tflite', 'flower_label.txt')
```

## Notebook

Currently, we support image classification and text classification tasks and
provide demo code and colab for each of them in demo folder.

* [Colab for text classification](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/tensorflow_examples/lite/model_maker/demo/text_classification.ipynb)
